This Privacy Policy explains how we process information when you use **Crypto Master Guide Universal** (the “Service”). We aim to keep data collection minimal and transparent. If you disagree with this Policy, please do not use the Service.

## 1. Scope
This Policy covers data processed when you:
- interact with the Service hosted on/through **Sahara AI** or related interfaces;
- view docs, links, or pages we host (e.g., GitHub Pages);
- contact us for support.

Third-party platforms (e.g., Sahara AI, GitHub, analytics tools, payment processors) have their own policies which apply independently.

## 2. What Data We Process
We intend to minimize personal data. Depending on your interaction, we may process:

- **Content You Provide:** prompts, messages, uploaded text files (assets), feedback, support requests.  
- **Usage Data:** timestamps, basic event logs (e.g., feature usage), approximate region/locale, performance metrics.  
- **Device/Technical Data:** browser type, OS, device type, referrer/URL parameters, IP-derived coarse location.  
- **Payment Data (if applicable):** processed by third-party provider; we do **not** store full payment card details.  
- **Account Data (if applicable):** display name, handle, email (when shared via the platform).  
- **Third-Party Data:** information available from Sahara AI platform APIs or integrations you authorize.  
- **Sensitive Data:** we do **not** seek sensitive categories. Please don’t submit them.

---

## 3. Sources of Data
- Directly from you (text you enter, files you upload).  
- Automatically via Service operation (logs/telemetry).  
- From platform providers (e.g., Sahara AI) per your account/app settings.

---

## 4. Purposes & Legal Bases (GDPR)
We process data to:
- **Provide the Service** (contract necessity, Art. 6(1)(b));  
- **Operate, secure, and improve** features, quality, and performance (legitimate interests, Art. 6(1)(f));  
- **Support & communications** (contract necessity / legitimate interests);  
- **Compliance & enforcement** (legal obligations, Art. 6(1)(c));  
- **With your consent** where required (Art. 6(1)(a)); you may withdraw consent at any time.

## 5. AI Processing & Safety
Your prompts and outputs may be processed by AI models (e.g., those available on Sahara AI). We apply reasonable safeguards (prompt hygiene, safety filters where available), but **AI outputs may be inaccurate or incomplete**. Avoid entering personal data or confidential information.

---

## 6. Retention
We retain data only as long as needed for the purposes above:
- Operational logs: typically short rolling windows.  
- Support records: until resolved + limited archival period.  
- Legal/compliance copies: as required by law.  

When no longer needed, data is deleted or anonymized.

## 7. Sharing & Disclosure
We may share with:
- **Service Providers / Subprocessors:** hosting, AI inference, analytics, support.  
- **Platform Providers:** Sahara AI, GitHub, file storage/CDN.  
- **Compliance/Law Enforcement:** if required by applicable law.  
- **Business Transfers:** in case of reorganization, merger, or asset transfer (with notice where feasible).

## 8. International Transfers
Data may be processed globally. Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards (e.g., SCCs, DPAs) with our vendors.

---

## 9. Security
We use reasonable technical and organizational measures (access controls, encryption in transit where available, least-privilege). No method is 100% secure; please protect your accounts and do not share secrets.

---

## 10. Your Rights
Depending on your location (e.g., EEA/UK/Switzerland), you may have rights to access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection.  

US (e.g., CA/VA/CO/CT/UT): you may have rights to know/access, delete, correct, opt-out of certain processing.
